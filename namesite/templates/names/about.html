<h1>About</h1>

<div class="about">
<p>Naming your baby? Trying to come up with a Google+ pseudonym or the hero's
name for your new novel? The possibilities are literally endless.</p>

<p>The names are randomly generated using
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">markov model</a>, based
on public data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This basically means that the
program "knows" that a real name that starts with "Jes" might end in "sie" or
"us".</p>

<p>Idea and code by Andr√© Laszlo. Want to offer me a job? Give me stuff? Just
