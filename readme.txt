random.name
-----------

A stupid site that creates (really) random names. Just for fun because I wanted
to play around with markov chains a little bit.

Scripts to create markov models reside in /random_name. The site is in /names
and is coded in Django. The environment is in /env.

I found some free hosting for this site at the french site alwaysdata.net. Play
with it here: http://randomname.alwaysdata.net
